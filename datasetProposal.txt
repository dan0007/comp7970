For our Bayes' Theorem Classification project, we will be using the two datasets provided in the project description.

There are two datasets, directed and undirected graphs. The directed graph has 5242 Nodes and 28980 Edges. This data can easily be stored in a 5242 x 5242 matrix
For the undirected graph, there are 317080 Nodes and 1049866 Edges. This larger dataset will be stored in a symmetric 317080 x 31708 matrix, where an edge at [A,B] means there is an edge at [B,A]

We will let each Node, which represents an author of a paper, represent a data tuple (X). Each Edge, which represents a co-author relationship, will be the attributes of that data tuple.
