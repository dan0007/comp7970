Tyler Idea
1.	Training Data
	a.	Take first 200 separate authors and their list of coauthors into a database, along with their total number of coauthor relationships
	b.	Take the author with largest number of coauthor relationships, and use them as the basis for the first class
	c.	Take the author with next largest number of coauthor relationships that isn’t a member of the first author’s coauthor relationships.
	d.	Repeat for 4 total classes of data
2.	Main data algorithm
	a.	Use Bayesian Classification of categorical data to select which group each author belongs to
		i.	P(A|X) = P(X|A) / P(A) where A is the group and X is the data tuple. Compare this value for the other 3 groups (P(B|X), etc.) and whichever value is largest is the group to where X goes
		ii.	P(X|A) can be modeled as the number of common coauthor relationships between tuple X and authors already in group A divided by total number of authors in group A
