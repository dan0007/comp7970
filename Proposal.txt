PROPOSAL:


//////////////////////////////

To preform Bayes Classigication algorithm we must define Bayes' Theorem. 
Let X be a data tuple("evidence"), and is composed of measuments made on a
set of N attributes. Let C be a specific class, and let H be a hypothesis to 
determine that X belongs to C. Since we are using the theorem for 
classification, we want to determine P(H|X), or "Posterior Probability." Let 
P(H|X) be the probability that H holds given our "evidence" (or X.)
Simply, theorem states that we are looking for the probability that the 
observed data turple belongs to a specified class, given we know the 
attribute discription of the observed data turple (book P350-8.3.1). 

Baye's Theorem is as follows:
	
				 P(X|H) P(H)
	P(H|X) = 	-------------
				 	P(X)
	




 The theorem states that we are looking for the probability that the observed data turple belongs to a specified class, given we know the attribute discription of the observed data turple (book P350-8.3.1).
